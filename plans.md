## Arduino Supplies

## Python plan

### Ideal Model
Using pysolar

P_I = A * I; where A is the area of our solar panel (m^2), I is the Solar Irradiance (W/m^2), and P_I is the Available Solar Power (W)

P = C * P_I, P = V * J; P is the power from the solar panel (W), J is the current (A), V is the voltage (V), and C is conversion rate

V is constant

### Non-ideal using meteorological data (NOAA)
Use real data for the solar irradiance I = I(t) and calculate the available power.
P_I(t) = A * I(t) For t-40 years.

#### pros
* Get more realistic data (cloud cover/weather conditions)

#### cons
* Way more noise (We can take the average or do ML to get more trends etc.)

### Validation using data collected from solar panels
P(t) = { hourly data for a few months }

Run the data through ML to get trends etc. (Maybe predict)

validate our equipment on the efficiency C = P/P_I
* Need to decide data to use for P_I: ideal data (no cloud cover) or average P_I(t) based on date/time-of-day (averaged over many years - climatological mean)
* Can take the average or rms of C(t)
* Analyze the trend/curve of power and conversion rate (daily variation)

## Main Objective for next week
### python team meeting
Nov 17th @ 5:00pm
Location: TBD
* Look at "pysolar" documentation
* see if pysolar or solarpy is better (Or third option?)

### Arduino
Order supplies
